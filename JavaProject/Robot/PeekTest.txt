Thanks 
International duty is over for some Manchester City players but a number of Blues will be in action tonight before they return to England's north-west.

Manuel Pellegrini's Blues travel to Crystal Palace for their second successive three o'clock kick-off in the Premier League this weekend, aiming to keep up their 100 per cent record.

City might face one selection dilemma at right-back, though, with Bacary Sagna injured on international duty, and Pellegrini will be keeping his fingers crossed nobody else picks up a knock.

We want you to get involved with the live blog today, too - tell us your thoughts on what’s happening at the Etihad by tweeting our MCFC Twitter page @ManCityMEN with all your thoughts on the day’s events.
